# GC_1.4
The first working verison of the Galactic Conquest Game I coded through Python. It still has many improvements to be made, such as the AI (which can win) and the upgrade system.

The game is made through Qt Designer and PyQt5 in unison. The game is set to mimic a Star Wars type sci fi environment where you, the player, are responsible for your Army (Galactic Army or Rebellion) to overrule the galaxy. 

You must build troops and strategize which planets to assault without risking one of your planets too much.

I grey out any buttons that currently don't work fully. There are some features that are almost there, but need some tuning, such as the ability to set taxes. I plan to make it so the taxes you set on your people will produce a more negative effect the higher they are.
